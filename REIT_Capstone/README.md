This project analyzes if publically avaiable REITS improve a portfolio. 
The project looks beyond the Sharpe Ratio to analyzing the distribution of Sector REITS.
This is primarily done through looking at skewness and kurtosis.

I focused the project on the visualizations of the distributions or equal-weighted indexes.
The two models seem to have not displayed the visualizations when uploaded to Github so please refer to the PDF 
to see the distribution of each sector and other visualizations.
